## Notes

- All processes should implement quality gates appropriate to their category
- Iterative refinement loops should be built into planning and validation processes
- Integration with existing methodologies (CRISP-DM, TDSP, Agile) is recommended
- Processes should be composable and reusable across different ML projects
- Human-in-the-loop validation gates are critical for production deployments
- Compliance and governance checkpoints should be integrated throughout
