- [ ] **Risk Planning and Assessment** - Conduct risk identification workshops, qualitative and quantitative analysis, response planning, and establish risk monitoring processes. [Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Identifying-Managing-Project-Risk-Essential/dp/0814413404)

- [ ] **Resource Planning and Allocation** - Identify resource requirements, assess availability, optimize allocation, and plan resource acquisition and management. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok)

- [ ] **Budget Development and Cost Estimation** - Develop project budget using estimation techniques (analogous, parametric, bottom-up), establish contingency reserves, and create cost baseline. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/cost-estimation-budgeting-project-success-6187)

## Execution Processes

- [ ] **Team Formation and Development** - Establish team structure, define roles and responsibilities (RACI), create working agreements, and build high-performing team culture. [Reference](https://www.tablegroup.com/product/dysfunctions/)

- [ ] **Status Reporting and Communication Management** - Create and deliver project status reports, dashboards, and communications tailored to different stakeholder audiences and needs. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-communications-management-plan-7948)

- [ ] **Quality Assurance Implementation** - Establish quality standards, implement quality processes, conduct quality audits, and ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok)

- [ ] **Vendor and Procurement Management** - Manage vendor relationships, contract administration, procurement processes, and supplier performance monitoring. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/procurement-management-plan-templates-6060)

---

## Monitoring and Control Processes

- [ ] **Earned Value Management (EVM)** - Implement earned value analysis to track schedule and cost performance (SPI, CPI, EAC, VAC) and forecast project outcomes. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/earned-value-management-best-practices-6133)

- [ ] **Change Control Management** - Establish and operate change control process including change request submission, impact assessment, CCB review, and implementation tracking. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/change-management-project-performance-4297)

- [ ] **Issue Management and Escalation** - Track, analyze, and resolve project issues with appropriate escalation pathways and root cause analysis. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/issue-management-project-success-6389)

- [ ] **Risk Monitoring and Response Execution** - Continuously monitor risk triggers, execute risk responses, track residual risks, and update risk register. [Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Waltzing-Bears-Managing-Software-Projects/dp/0932633609)

---

## Agile Processes

- [ ] **Sprint Planning and Backlog Refinement** - Facilitate sprint planning sessions, refine product backlog, estimate user stories, and establish sprint goals and commitments. [Reference](https://scrumguides.org/)

- [ ] **Sprint Review and Demonstration** - Conduct sprint reviews to demonstrate completed work, gather stakeholder feedback, and update product backlog based on insights. [Reference](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-review)

- [ ] **Sprint Retrospective Facilitation** - Facilitate team retrospectives to identify improvements, celebrate successes, address challenges, and commit to actionable changes. [Reference](https://www.scrumalliance.org/agile-resources/agile-retrospectives)

- [ ] **Agile Metrics and Velocity Tracking** - Track and analyze Agile metrics including velocity, burndown/burnup charts, cycle time, and team capacity for forecasting. [Reference](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/measuring-agile-team-performance)

- [ ] **Kanban Flow Optimization** - Implement and optimize Kanban boards, WIP limits, flow metrics, and continuous improvement practices for work management. [Reference](https://kanbanguides.org/)

---

## Portfolio and Program Management Processes

- [ ] **Portfolio Prioritization and Investment Analysis** - Evaluate and prioritize project portfolio using strategic alignment, financial analysis (NPV, IRR), risk-reward optimization, and resource capacity. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/portfolio-management)

- [ ] **Benefits Realization Management** - Define benefit metrics, create realization plan, track benefits delivery, and ensure intended business outcomes are achieved from investments. [Reference](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/msp)

- [ ] **Program Dependency Management** - Map, analyze, and manage cross-project dependencies including resource conflicts, deliverable dependencies, and schedule impacts. [Reference](https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/program-management)
