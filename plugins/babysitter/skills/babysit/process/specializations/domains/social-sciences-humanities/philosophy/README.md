# Philosophy and Theology Specialization

## Overview

The Philosophy and Theology specialization encompasses the systematic study of fundamental questions concerning existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, language, and religious belief. This domain integrates philosophical inquiry with theological reflection, providing frameworks for examining the deepest questions about reality, morality, meaning, and the divine.

This specialization supports practitioners in Philosophy, Theology, Ethics, Logic, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Religious Studies, and Critical Thinking, offering structured approaches to rigorous intellectual inquiry and reasoned discourse.

## Description

Philosophy and Theology represent humanity's oldest and most enduring intellectual traditions. Philosophy, derived from the Greek "love of wisdom," seeks to understand the nature of reality, knowledge, and values through rational argumentation and critical analysis. Theology, the systematic study of the divine and religious belief, employs both faith-based and rational approaches to explore questions of ultimate concern.

- **Metaphysics**: The study of the fundamental nature of reality, existence, being, and the world
- **Epistemology**: The theory of knowledge, examining its nature, scope, and limits
- **Ethics and Moral Philosophy**: The systematic study of right and wrong, virtue and vice
- **Logic**: The study of valid reasoning and argumentation
- **Philosophy of Religion**: Critical examination of religious beliefs and practices
- **Systematic Theology**: Organized articulation of religious doctrines and beliefs
