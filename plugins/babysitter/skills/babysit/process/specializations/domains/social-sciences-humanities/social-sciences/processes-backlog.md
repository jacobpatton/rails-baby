- [ ] **Social Network Analysis** - Map and analyze social network structures including centrality measures, community detection, tie strength analysis, and network visualization using Gephi or UCINET. [Reference](https://gephi.org/)

## Causal Inference Processes

- [ ] **Propensity Score Analysis** - Implement propensity score matching, weighting, and stratification methods to estimate treatment effects from observational data while addressing selection bias. [Reference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/counterfactuals-and-causal-inference/)

- [ ] **Natural Experiment Analysis** - Identify and analyze natural experiments using instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or difference-in-differences designs for causal identification. [Reference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/)

## Theory Development Processes

- [ ] **Grounded Theory Development** - Build theory inductively from qualitative data through systematic coding, constant comparison, theoretical sampling, and memo writing until theoretical saturation. [Reference](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/constructing-grounded-theory/book235960)

- [ ] **Literature Review and Synthesis** - Conduct systematic literature reviews including search strategy development, quality assessment, evidence synthesis, and identification of research gaps. [Reference](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/research-design/book255675)

## Policy Analysis Processes

- [ ] **Policy Impact Assessment** - Evaluate policy effects using program evaluation methods, cost-benefit analysis, stakeholder analysis, and evidence synthesis for evidence-based recommendations. [Reference](https://www.eval.org/)

- [ ] **Program Evaluation** - Design and conduct formative, summative, and developmental evaluations of social programs including logic models, outcome measurement, and implementation fidelity assessment.
