# Humanities and Anthropology - Processes Backlog

## Phase 2: Process Implementation Backlog

This document tracks the implementation status of key processes for the Humanities and Anthropology specialization. Each process represents a distinct workflow that can be orchestrated through the babysitter system.

## Ethnographic Research Processes

- [ ] **Ethnographic Fieldwork Planning** - Design and prepare for immersive fieldwork including site selection, ethical approval, community engagement protocols, and research methodology framework development. [Reference](https://www.americananthro.org/)

- [ ] **Participant Observation Protocol** - Conduct systematic participant observation with structured field note taking, daily reflection, and iterative analysis during extended community immersion. [Reference](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15481433)

- [ ] **Ethnographic Interview Methodology** - Design and conduct semi-structured interviews, life history collection, and key informant interviews with proper consent protocols and cultural sensitivity. [Reference](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo12182616.html)

- [ ] **Visual Ethnography Documentation** - Create photographic, video, and audio documentation of cultural practices, rituals, and daily life with appropriate community permissions and metadata standards. [Reference](https://journal.culanth.org/)

---

## Historical Research Processes

- [ ] **Archival Research Methodology** - Navigate archival systems, identify relevant collections, transcribe and digitize primary sources, and organize materials with proper scholarly apparatus. [Reference](https://www.archives.gov/)

- [ ] **Primary Source Analysis** - Authenticate, date, and critically evaluate historical documents including assessment of provenance, bias, reliability, and contextualization within broader evidence. [Reference](https://www.historians.org/)

- [ ] **Oral History Collection Protocol** - Record, transcribe, and preserve personal testimonies following oral history best practices including informed consent, interview techniques, and archival standards. [Reference](https://www.oralhistory.org/)

- [ ] **Historical Narrative Construction** - Develop historical arguments and narratives through evidence synthesis, historiographical positioning, and addressing counterevidence with scholarly rigor. [Reference](https://academic.oup.com/ahr)

---

## Literary Analysis Processes

- [ ] **Close Reading Analysis** - Perform detailed textual analysis identifying patterns in language, imagery, structure, and intertextual references with systematic annotation methodology. [Reference](https://www.mlajournals.org/loi/pmla)

- [ ] **Literary Theoretical Application** - Apply critical frameworks (formalist, structuralist, post-structuralist, postcolonial, feminist) to texts with engagement of existing scholarly criticism. [Reference](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/144)

- [ ] **Textual Criticism and Editing** - Establish authoritative texts through manuscript analysis, variant comparison, emendation, and scholarly apparatus development. [Reference](https://www.mla.org/)

- [ ] **Comparative Literature Analysis** - Analyze texts across linguistic and cultural boundaries examining influence, translation, adaptation, and transnational literary movements. [Reference](https://read.dukeupress.edu/comparative-literature)

---

## Linguistic Analysis Processes

- [ ] **Language Documentation Project** - Conduct comprehensive endangered language documentation including phonological, morphological, and syntactic analysis with community collaboration. [Reference](https://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc/)

- [ ] **Phonetic and Phonological Analysis** - Analyze sound systems using IPA transcription, acoustic analysis, and phonological rule formulation for language description. [Reference](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/112)

- [ ] **Sociolinguistic Survey Methodology** - Design and conduct sociolinguistic research examining language variation, attitudes, and use in social context with appropriate sampling strategies. [Reference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-in-society)

- [ ] **Corpus Linguistics Analysis** - Build, annotate, and analyze linguistic corpora using computational tools for pattern discovery and quantitative language analysis. [Reference](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/)

---

## Digital Humanities Processes

- [ ] **Text Mining and Distant Reading** - Apply computational text analysis methods including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and pattern recognition across large textual corpora. [Reference](https://voyant-tools.org/)

- [ ] **Digital Archive Development** - Create and curate digital collections following metadata standards (Dublin Core, TEI), IIIF protocols, and long-term preservation practices. [Reference](https://omeka.org/)

- [ ] **Spatial Humanities Mapping** - Develop GIS-based historical and cultural analysis integrating geographic data with humanities research questions. [Reference](https://neatline.org/)

- [ ] **Network Analysis for Humanities** - Apply network analysis methods to historical correspondence, literary influence, social relationships, and cultural connections. [Reference](https://adho.org/)

- [ ] **Data Visualization for Cultural Research** - Create meaningful visualizations of humanistic data including timelines, maps, graphs, and interactive displays for scholarly communication. [Reference](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/)

---

## Publication and Peer Review Processes

- [ ] **Scholarly Article Development** - Draft, revise, and prepare humanities scholarship for peer-reviewed publication including proper citation, argumentation, and formatting. [Reference](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/)

- [ ] **Peer Review Evaluation Protocol** - Conduct constructive peer review of humanities scholarship evaluating methodology, evidence, argumentation, and contribution to the field. [Reference](https://academic.oup.com/past)

- [ ] **Research Ethics Review** - Navigate IRB/ethics review processes for human subjects research including informed consent, community protocols, and sensitive materials handling. [Reference](https://www.americananthro.org/)

- [ ] **Grant Proposal Development** - Prepare competitive research funding proposals for humanities projects including NEH, ACLS, and foundation grants. [Reference](https://www.neh.gov/)

## Notes

- Each process should be implemented as a JavaScript module following the babysitter process framework
- Processes should integrate with available skills and subagents for quality-gated iterative workflows
- Community engagement and ethical protocols are paramount for ethnographic and linguistic research processes
- Digital humanities processes should leverage computational tools while maintaining interpretive rigor
