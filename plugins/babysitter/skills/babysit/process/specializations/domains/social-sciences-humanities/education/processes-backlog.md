- [ ] **Action Mapping** - Performance-focused training design that starts with business goals, identifies required behaviors, designs practice activities, and determines minimum necessary information. [Reference](https://blog.cathy-moore.com/action-mapping/)

- [ ] **Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction** - Systematic framework for sequencing instructional activities including attention, objectives, recall, presentation, guidance, practice, feedback, assessment, and transfer. [Reference](https://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/conditions-learning/)

## Curriculum Development Processes

- [ ] **Standards-Based Curriculum Alignment** - Systematic mapping of curriculum to educational standards ensuring vertical alignment across grade levels and horizontal alignment across subjects. [Reference](http://www.corestandards.org/)

- [ ] **Curriculum Mapping (Jacobs Model)** - Visual documentation of curriculum including content, skills, assessments, and resources organized by time and subject to identify gaps and redundancies. [Reference](https://www.ascd.org/books/mapping-the-big-picture-integrating-curriculum-and-assessment-k-12)

- [ ] **Learning Progression Development** - Creating coherent sequences of learning experiences that build upon prior knowledge across grade levels using research-based progressions. [Reference](https://www.nextgenscience.org/)

- [ ] **Scope and Sequence Planning** - Systematic development of curriculum breadth (scope) and order (sequence) ensuring comprehensive coverage and logical progression of content. [Reference](https://www.ascd.org/books/understanding-by-design-expanded-2nd-edition)

## Assessment Processes

- [ ] **Formative Assessment Design** - Creating ongoing assessments that provide immediate feedback to inform instruction and support learning during the instructional process. [Reference](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Classroom+Assessment+Techniques%3A+A+Handbook+for+College+Teachers%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781555425005)

- [ ] **Summative Assessment Development** - Designing end-of-unit or end-of-course assessments that measure student achievement against learning objectives with validity and reliability. [Reference](https://www.testingstandards.net/)

- [ ] **Rubric Development and Validation** - Creating clear, reliable scoring rubrics with defined criteria and performance levels for consistent assessment of student work. [Reference](https://www.ascd.org/books/the-understanding-by-design-guide-to-creating-high-quality-units)

- [ ] **Item Writing and Test Development** - Systematic development of assessment items across formats (multiple choice, constructed response) following psychometric best practices. [Reference](https://www.testingstandards.net/)

- [ ] **Bloom's Taxonomy Application** - Applying cognitive taxonomy levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create) to write measurable learning objectives and design aligned assessments. [Reference](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)

## Learning Technology Processes

- [ ] **LMS Administration and Configuration** - Systematic setup, configuration, and management of learning management systems including user roles, integrations, and course templates. [Reference](https://www.instructure.com/canvas)

- [ ] **E-Learning Course Authoring** - Development of interactive digital learning content using authoring tools (Articulate, Captivate) following multimedia learning principles. [Reference](https://articulate.com/360)

- [ ] **SCORM/xAPI Package Development** - Creating standards-compliant learning packages for interoperability across LMS platforms with proper tracking and reporting. [Reference](https://xapi.com/)

- [ ] **Quality Matters Course Review** - Applying QM rubric standards to evaluate and improve online course design across eight general standards. [Reference](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards)

- [ ] **Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Implementation** - Applying UDL principles to provide multiple means of engagement, representation, and action/expression for diverse learners. [Reference](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/)

---

## Faculty Development Processes

- [ ] **Teaching Effectiveness Workshop Design** - Developing professional development workshops to enhance pedagogical skills using evidence-based teaching practices. [Reference](https://learningforward.org/standards/)

## Implementation Notes

- Processes should be implemented with quality-gated iterative development loops
- Each process should include validation and verification steps
- Integration with existing specialization frameworks (ADDIE, UbD, UDL) is essential
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG, Section 508) must be considered in all processes
- Processes should support both K-12 and higher education/corporate training contexts
