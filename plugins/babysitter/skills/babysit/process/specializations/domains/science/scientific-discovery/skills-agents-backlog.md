## Notes

- All skills should implement standardized input/output schemas for composability with reasoning processes
- Skills should support both automated and human-in-the-loop execution modes
- Agents should provide detailed reasoning traces for scientific auditability
- Error handling should distinguish between methodological errors and data errors
- Logging should capture decision points for reproducibility documentation
- Skills should support domain-specific terminology and conventions
- Agents should be able to cite relevant methodological literature in their recommendations
- Integration with reference managers should be prioritized for academic workflows
- Support for multiple output formats (LaTeX, Word, HTML) should be standard
- Version control integration should be built into all documentation skills
