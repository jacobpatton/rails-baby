## Product Frameworks

### Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

- Functional, emotional, and social dimensions of jobs

**Resources**:

- Tony Ulwick: "Jobs to Be Done: Theory to Practice"
- Clayton Christensen: "Competing Against Luck"

### Product-Market Fit (PMF)

**Description**: The degree to which a product satisfies strong market demand, often measured by customer retention, engagement, and growth metrics.

- Market sizing and addressable market
- Customer retention curves

**Resources**:

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Scoring

**Description**: A prioritization framework that scores initiatives based on Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort.

**Formula**: `Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

**Components**:
- **Reach**: How many people will this impact in a given time period?
- **Impact**: How much will this impact each person? (3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal)
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates? (100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low)
- **Effort**: How many person-months will this take?

**Resources**:
- Intercom: [RICE Scoring Guide](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/)
- Sean McBride: "RICE: Simple prioritization for product managers"

**Use Cases**:
- Feature prioritization
- Roadmap planning
- Resource allocation
- Backlog grooming

### MoSCoW Method

**Description**: A prioritization technique that categorizes requirements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have.

**Categories**:
- **Must have**: Critical requirements without which the project fails
- **Should have**: Important but not vital requirements
- **Could have**: Desirable but not necessary requirements
- **Won't have**: Lowest priority items, not planned for this release

**Resources**:
- Dai Clegg: "Case Method Fast-Track: A RAD Approach"
- ProductPlan: [MoSCoW Prioritization Guide](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/moscow-prioritization/)

**Use Cases**:
- Sprint planning
- MVP definition
- Stakeholder alignment
- Scope management

#### Value vs. Effort Matrix
