# A/B Test Design Skill

Statistical experiment design and analysis capabilities for product experimentation.

## Purpose

This skill provides rigorous statistical experiment design and analysis capabilities. It helps product teams design valid experiments, calculate appropriate sample sizes, and make data-driven decisions based on experiment results.

## Key Capabilities

- **Sample Size Calculation**: Determine required sample sizes for statistical power
- **Experiment Design**: Create well-structured A/B and multivariate test plans
- **Statistical Validation**: Validate significance and calculate effect sizes
- **Decision Framework**: Provide ship/iterate/kill recommendations
- **Segment Analysis**: Detect interaction effects across user segments

## Process Integration

Integrates with:
- Product Market Fit Process (validation experiments)
- Conversion Funnel Analysis Process (funnel optimization)
- Beta Program Process (beta testing experiments)

## Usage

Invoke this skill when designing experiments, analyzing test results, or making decisions about feature launches based on experimental data.
