# Multi-Robot Coordination Skill

## Overview

Expert skill for coordinating multi-robot systems including task allocation, path planning, and collision avoidance for robot fleets.

## Capabilities

- Implement auction-based task allocation
- Configure market-based coordination
- Set up conflict-based search (CBS) for path planning
- Implement ORCA/RVO collision avoidance
- Configure formation control algorithms
- Set up distributed consensus protocols
- Implement priority-based planning
- Configure multi-master ROS communication
- Set up fleet management APIs
- Implement traffic management zones

## Target Processes

- multi-robot-coordination.js
- fleet-management-system.js
- path-planning-algorithm.js
- dynamic-obstacle-avoidance.js

## Dependencies

- multimaster_fkie
- free_fleet
- Open-RMF

## Usage Context

This skill is invoked when processes require multi-robot coordination, fleet management, or multi-agent path planning.

## Output Artifacts

- Task allocation algorithms
- Multi-robot path planners
- Collision avoidance configurations
- Formation control implementations
- Fleet management APIs
- Traffic zone configurations
